					<h3>Highlights</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Design, development, and leadership around mHealth software is how I’ve enjoyed spending my time for the past 6 years.</li>
						<li>I work directly with mHealth clients to create novel apps and back-end systems, and I put a lot of importance on maintaining clear communication and processes to foster iterative development and achieve the best products possible.</li>
						<li>I enjoy and have significant experience in mHealth research, publishing articles, and presenting at conferences.</li>
						<li>I’ve successflily written grant applications and patents (and have tried my hand at marketing material when it’s needed).</li>
						<li>My actual education background is in physics, and biomedical and electrical engineering, which I believe taught me how to truly think analytically.</li>

						<p>"Small Data" is the myriad of digital data traces we each generate everyday.  The Small Data Lab is creating the apps and infrastructure to put your small data to good use for you.  They create open-source infrastructure and apps to collect and analyze these traces, in order to convert small data into big insight.</p>

						<ol>
							<li>Updated their back-end system to a modular, container based infrastructure and continue to maintain production environments. (Docker, SpringBoot, nginx, Ruby on Rails, and Clojure)</li>
							<li>Add new features and perform maintenance on the variety of mobile apps they offer. (Android)</li>
